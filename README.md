MyIrc
=====

An IRC client and server with a GTK interface.

This project's aim was to create a simple msn-like, with a client and a server capable of handling several channels, private discussion, etc.

It's was coded using sockets in C, with the circular buffer technique for the server.

The client was made in C++, using GTK.
